<p>C:</p>
<p>The most important language in the world. It’s what operating systems like Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android are written in, as well as browsers and 3D games engines. Its syntax has influenced countless other programming languages.

C maps closely to Assembly Language but you can write more complex programmes with it. If you need the highest performance possible without losing your mind then C is for you.

C is also the language that made “Hello, World” examples popular.</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
</code>
</pre>
</article>

<article>
<p>C++</p>
<p>Has performance close to C and is used in many important projects like the Chrome Browser. C++ was an effort to make a language that was easier to build large projects with while still being fast and efficient.</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!\n";
    return 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
</article>

<article>
<p>java</p>
<p>Something that made Java special is that it was designed so you could write code once and then allow it to run on any operation system. Java is the most popular programming language in the world. It’s used to teach students and in large companies. All Android apps are written in Java.</p>
<pre>
<code>
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
</article>

<article>
<p>python</p>
<p>Has a compact syntax needing far fewer lines of code than languages like Java or C++. It’s very popular and is used for websites and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
print("Hello World")
</code>
